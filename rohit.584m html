I Rohit Murmu
My Dearest Nidhi,

From the moment we first met, you have brought a light and joy into my life that I never knew I was missing. Each day with you is a beautiful adventure, filled with laughter, love, and the kind of happiness I’ve always dreamed of. You have touched my heart in ways words can scarcely capture, and I find myself falling more deeply in love with you with each passing day.

There is something incredibly special about the way we connect. With you, I’ve found a partner who understands me, supports me, and loves me unconditionally. Your kindness, your strength, and your unwavering support make me feel cherished and valued in ways I’ve never known before. I am continually amazed by your ability to make even the simplest moments extraordinary.

As I think about our future together, my heart is filled with excitement and hope. I envision a life where we share our dreams, our adventures, and our deepest moments of joy and challenge. I can’t imagine facing the future without you by my side. You are my best friend, my confidant, and my greatest love, and I want to build a lifetime of memories with you.

So, with all the love in my heart, I am asking you to take the next step with me. Nidhi, will you marry me? Will you make me the happiest person in the world by saying yes? I promise to love you deeply, to stand by you through all of life’s challenges, and to cherish you every single day.

Forever and always,

[Rohit Murmu]
